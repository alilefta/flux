# Flux Development Contract

I'm, Ali, commit to:

1. **Timeline**: Ship MVP in 14 days (by December 27)
2. **Scope**: ONLY features in MUST-HAVE list
3. **Daily Progress**: At least 1 task per day
4. **Content**: Post about progress EVERY day
5. **No Scope Creep**: If I add a feature not in spec, I delete it

If I violate this contract:

- I will delete the extra feature immediately
- I will post about what I learned from the mistake
